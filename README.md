üåü Features

üéôÔ∏è Voice Recognition - Converts speech to text using Google Speech Recognition
ü§ñ AI-Powered Responses - Integrates with OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent conversations
üîä Text-to-Speech - Natural voice output using pyttsx3
üåê Web Automation - Opens websites (YouTube, Google, GitHub) via voice commands
üìÖ Information Queries - Get current time, date, and Wikipedia searches
üí¨ Natural Conversation - Handles general questions and casual chat
üîí Secure - API keys properly managed and excluded from version control

üé• Demo
User: "Hello, how are you?"
Assistant: "Hello! I'm your voice assistant. How can I help you today?"

User: "Open YouTube"
Assistant: "Opening YouTube" [Opens YouTube in browser]

User: "What time is it?"
Assistant: "The current time is 3:45 PM"

User: "Tell me about artificial intelligence"
Assistant: [Provides detailed AI explanation from GPT-4]
üìã Prerequisites
Before running this application, make sure you have:

Python 3.7+ installed
OpenAI API key from OpenAI Platform
Microphone and speakers/headphones
Stable internet connection

üöÄ Quick Start
1. Clone the Repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/Divamaddala/voice-assistant-final.git
cd voice-assistant-final
2. Install Dependencies
bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Note for Windows users: If you encounter PyAudio installation issues:
bashpip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
Note for macOS users: You might need to install PortAudio first:
bashbrew install portaudio
pip install pyaudio
3. Setup OpenAI API Key

Get your API key from OpenAI Platform
Create a file named apikey.py in the project root
Add your API key:

pythonapi_data = "sk-your-actual-api-key-here"
4. Run the Assistant
bashpython main.py
Wait for the greeting message, then start speaking your commands!

Key Classes and Functions

VoiceAssistant - Main assistant class
listen() - Captures and processes audio input
get_gpt_response() - Interfaces with OpenAI API
speak() - Converts text to speech
process_command() - Handles specific commands

üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
Voice Settings
Modify TTS properties in the __init__ method:
pythonself.engine.setProperty('rate', 180)    # Speech speed
self.engine.setProperty('volume', 0.9)  # Volume level
Recognition Settings
Adjust speech recognition parameters:
pythonself.recognizer.pause_threshold = 1     # Pause detection
# Timeout and phrase limits in listen() method
GPT Model Configuration
Change the model or parameters in get_gpt_response():
pythonmodel = "gpt-4o"  # or "gpt-3.5-turbo" for cost efficiency
max_tokens = 150  # Response length limit
temperature = 0.7 # Response creativity (0.0-1.0)
üîç Troubleshooting
Common Issues and Solutions
Microphone Not Detected

Check system microphone permissions
Ensure microphone is not muted
Try python -m speech_recognition to test

OpenAI API Errors

Verify your API key is correct
Check your OpenAI account has sufficient credits
Ensure stable internet connection

Audio Output Issues

Check speaker/headphone connections
Verify system audio settings
Try different TTS voices in the code

Import/Installation Errors

Reinstall packages: pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
For PyAudio issues, see installation notes above
Check Python version compatibility (3.7+)

Speech Recognition Problems

Speak clearly and at moderate pace
Reduce background noise
Adjust microphone positioning
Check pause_threshold setting

üåê Deployment Options
Option 1: Local Desktop Application

Run directly with python main.py
Create executable with PyInstaller:

bashpip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
Option 2: Web Application

Deploy app.py using Flask to platforms like:

Heroku
Railway
Render
PythonAnywhere



Option 3: Container Deployment
dockerfile# Basic Dockerfile structure
FROM python:3.9-slim
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
üîí Security Considerations

API Key Protection: Never commit apikey.py to version control
Environment Variables: Use .env files for production deployment
Rate Limiting: Monitor OpenAI API usage to avoid unexpected charges
Input Validation: The assistant processes all voice input through OpenAI
